### Modern Problem
The consent dialogues are a persistent annoyance to the web. The manipulative practices in terms of complexity in language, blocking access to the webpage or pre-selected choices used by several CMP providers often lead to deceiving a user to disregard and agree to data collection.

Despite the regulations, several web services continue to mislead and register positive consent even when a user has opted out or made a choice for not sharing their data.

The end-user has to make an explicit and informed choice to allow sharing their data to participating third-party tracking services on the website.

### Modern Solution
To target the problematic part in the consent dialogues that violates the compliance with the GDPR. I have developed a browser extension to remove select elements which are responsible for storing positive consent to all user data and provide its users' granular control over their consent choices.
